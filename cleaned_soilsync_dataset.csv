Potato: Just before planting apply 1 ton/acre of well decomposed manure or compost, 4 kg/acre of zinc sulphate and 80 kg/acre of TSP. The manure and fertilizer should be well worked into the soil to avoid close contact with the seeds. 
Fruit trees: At transplanting time apply 10 kg of manure or compost mixed with 50 gm of TSP and top soil per planting hole. Two months after transplanting apply 100 gm of CAN per tree. Apply 100 gm/tree per year of CAN at the beginning of rains. To correct zinc deficiency apply a foliar feed in accordance with manufacture's instructions/ guide. "
